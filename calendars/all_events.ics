 0 British Cars at some shows. The British Car Gathering is now held on the
  grounds of the Talley Ho Inn in Townsend\, Tennessee. The Gathering has b
 een open to all British cars and motorcycles.\n\nAgain this year\, we are 
 partnering with the Knoxville English Auto Society and the show is open to
  all makes of European classic cars as well as the traditional British car
 s we've featured before.\n\nEach year\, the Gathering draws cars from all 
 states surrounding and including Tennessee and as far north as Michigan\, 
 as far south as Florida and many other the places in between. Motorcars ha
 ve ranged from a 1932 Morris sedan and a 1935 MG Airline Coupe to 1950s\, 
 1960s and newer models of MG\, Triumph\, Austin-Healey\, Jaguar\, Land Rov
 er\, Rolls-Royce\, Minis and Sunbeams. We have also had De Loreans and an 
 Amphicar. We even had an Austin-Healey Boat at one show. Owners range from
  teenagers to Senior Citizens!\n\nProceeds from the Gatherings are donated
  to various deserving local charities\, selected by a special comittee.\n\

 llow tents (EZ UP\, 10×10 max) but we only allow them in the grass parkin
 g lot\, and they must be fastened to the ground with stakes or weights.\n*
  Always follow the instructions from our parking crew—we try to pack as 
 many cars as possible into the area\, so respect the parking crew’s dire
 ction!\n*Trailers are permitted. If you have a drag car\, or any vehicle t
 hat requires being towed in on a trailer\, please use the Finley Stadium p
 arking lot for trailers.\n* Official hours are 10am to 4pm EST\, but cars 
 start showing up early and the best parking is limited and fills up quickl
 y. Overflow parking for the event is the north Finley Stadium parking lot.
  As cars come and go throughout the day\, you are welcome to move your car
  from overflow into the main cruise-in area.\n* Last but not least: Have F
