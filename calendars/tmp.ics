DESCRIPTION:Website: http://www.blountbritishcars.org/gathering.htm\n Loca
 tion: Townsend\n\n\n\nBlount British Cars\, Ltd. has become a leader in th
 e East Tennessee area by hosting a British Car Gathering each spring. The 
 first year\, we "Gathered" at Maryville College for British Day with 16 ca
 rs. Since then we have grown to more than 150 British Cars at some shows. 
 The British Car Gathering is now held on the grounds of the Talley Ho Inn 
 in Townsend\, Tennessee. The Gathering has been open to all British cars a
 nd motorcycles.\n\nAgain this year\, we are partnering with the Knoxville 
 English Auto Society and the show is open to all makes of European classic
  cars as well as the traditional British cars we've featured before.\n\nEa
 ch year\, the Gathering draws cars from all states surrounding and includi
 ng Tennessee and as far north as Michigan\, as far south as Florida and ma
 ny other the places in between. Motorcars have ranged from a 1932 Morris s
 edan and a 1935 MG Airline Coupe to 1950s\, 1960s and newer models of MG\,
  Triumph\, Austin-Healey\, Jaguar\, Land Rover\, Rolls-Royce\, Minis and S
 unbeams. We have also had De Loreans and an Amphicar. We even had an Austi
 n-Healey Boat at one show. Owners range from teenagers to Senior Citizens!
 \n\nProceeds from the Gatherings are donated to various deserving local ch
 arities\, selected by a special comittee.\n\nMore info at event website.\n
