All cars, trucks, bikes welcome.

Cars & Coffee is a gathering of all types of car lovers. It started in 2008 as a small get together for Knoxville car guys to have something to do on a Saturday. However, it's grown into quite an event, so much so that many people drive from out of state just to attend. The event is always held on the first Saturday of every other month. Come be a part,  here in the parking lot (and overflowing down all the nearby roads) of European Auto Garage. We are the official Knoxville Cars and Coffee.

Please note that there will also be an event in April @ Regal Pinnacle 18 (Turkey Creek) see that day's event for more information.
