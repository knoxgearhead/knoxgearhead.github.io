10am - 4pm

Attention! We have announced the date for the 2016 Chattanooga Cruise In! Mark your calendars for Saturday, April 2, 2016! The event consists of a huge gathering of cars, trucks and motorcycles, and an Open House at the Coker Tire, Honest Charley Speed Shop and Honest Charley Garage facilities. We’ll have music, as well as give-aways and promotions throughout the day. Several food vendors will be set up, and T-Bones and Southside Saloon & Bistro will be open for food and refreshments.

Car clubs are welcome, but please contact us before hand if you plan on parking together. We realize everyone wants a great parking spot, so early arrivals are not turned away, but please be advised that setup may not be complete if you get here early. You can expect to see hundreds of cars at this event, so plan your trip to Chattanooga now and experience one of the greatest Cruise Ins in the South!

The goal for the Chattanooga Cruise In is to have a great time and enjoy the old car hobby with lots of friends. We want to keep the list of rules and guidelines very simple and straightforward.

* Saving parking spots is not permitted. If you want to park next to a friend, be sure to drive in to the event together.
* Car clubs are welcome! Feel free to bring your whole crew, but let us know ahead of time, so we can reserve the appropriate amount of space!
* We allow tents (EZ UP, 10×10 max) but we only allow them in the grass parking lot, and they must be fastened to the ground with stakes or weights.
* Always follow the instructions from our parking crew—we try to pack as many cars as possible into the area, so respect the parking crew’s direction!
*Trailers are permitted. If you have a drag car, or any vehicle that requires being towed in on a trailer, please use the Finley Stadium parking lot for trailers.
* Official hours are 10am to 4pm EST, but cars start showing up early and the best parking is limited and fills up quickly. Overflow parking for the event is the north Finley Stadium parking lot. As cars come and go throughout the day, you are welcome to move your car from overflow into the main cruise-in area.
* Last but not least: Have FUN!
