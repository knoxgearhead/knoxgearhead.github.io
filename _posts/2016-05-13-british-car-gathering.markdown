Blount British Cars, Ltd. has become a leader in the East Tennessee area by hosting a British Car Gathering each spring. The first year, we "Gathered" at Maryville College for British Day with 16 cars. Since then we have grown to more than 150 British Cars at some shows. The British Car Gathering is now held on the grounds of the Talley Ho Inn in Townsend, Tennessee. The Gathering has been open to all British cars and motorcycles.

Again this year, we are partnering with the Knoxville English Auto Society and the show is open to all makes of European classic cars as well as the traditional British cars we've featured before.

Each year, the Gathering draws cars from all states surrounding and including Tennessee and as far north as Michigan, as far south as Florida and many other the places in between. Motorcars have ranged from a 1932 Morris sedan and a 1935 MG Airline Coupe to 1950s, 1960s and newer models of MG, Triumph, Austin-Healey, Jaguar, Land Rover, Rolls-Royce, Minis and Sunbeams. We have also had De Loreans and an Amphicar. We even had an Austin-Healey Boat at one show. Owners range from teenagers to Senior Citizens!

Proceeds from the Gatherings are donated to various deserving local charities, selected by a special comittee.
